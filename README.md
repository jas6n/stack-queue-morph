# Letterman to the rescue!

This program is given a dictionary of words, a “beginning” word and an “ending” word, and which types of conversions you are allowed to perform (such as changing one letter to another, adding or deleting a letter, etc.). This program converts the beginning word to another word, to another word, etc., eventually leading to the ending word, making one change at a time. Specified conversions are only used, and only valid words in the dictionary are used. For example, the program could change “chip” into “chop”, but can't change “chip” into “chiz” because the word “chiz” doesn’t exist in the dictionary.
